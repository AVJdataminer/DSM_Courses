    "This is your short course on Linear Regression, feel free to skip around based on your interest level and time constraints. There is a python exercise notebook at the end of this document that provides the structure for problem-solving with linear regression but is limited in-depth on Linear Regression, which is found more in the video lessons and the other materials. Happy Learning!"
