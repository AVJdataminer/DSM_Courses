This is your short course on Lasso Regression, feel free to skip around based on your interest level and time constraints. There is a python exercise notebook in this document that provides an applied example of using Lasso Regression within the structure of the Data Science Method for solving problems with data science. More details and in-depth content on Lasso Regression is found in the video lessons and the other materials in this document. Happy Learning!
